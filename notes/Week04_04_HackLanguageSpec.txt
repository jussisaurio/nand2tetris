A-INSTRUCTION:

Symbolic syntax:

@val, ex @21

Set Address register to val

val 0 >= <= 32767, or a symbol referring to such a value


Binary syntax:

0val, val 15-bit number. ex 0 000000000010101 <- set A register to 21. Leading 0 = A-Instruction



C-INSTRUCTION:

dest = comp ; jump

Binary: 1 1 1 a c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 d1 d2 d3 j1 j2 j3

first: opcode (0 = A-instruction, 1 = C-instruction)
2-3: unused, set to 1 by convention
a-c6: comp bits, sent to ALU!
d: dest bits (symbols A, D, ... AMD, 2^3=8 combos)
j: jump bits (8 combos)


The resulting binary sequence will conform to the CPU's ALU so that it executes the right instructions on the hardware.
