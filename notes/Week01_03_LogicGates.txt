Gate Logic: implement boolean functions using logic gates

Elementary logic gates (Nand, And, Or, Not...)

Composite logic gates (Adder, etc... based on elementary logic gates)


- Example of composite gate: 3-way AND.
  * feed A and B through an AND gate
  * feed the result, AB, to another AND gate with C
  * Associative, so the order of A,B,C doesnt matter


Gate Interface = the abstraction. What does the chip do? In this case, compute AND for three values.
Gate Implementation = how this is actually achieved

Interface is unique, implementations can vary.

Example circuit implementation of AND: two relays in series. OR: two relays in parallel.
