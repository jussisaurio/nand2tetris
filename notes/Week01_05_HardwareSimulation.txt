Load HDL code into hardware simulator program. The simulator emulates and tests the language.

Simulator options:
- Interactive (manual)
- Script-based
- With/without output and compare files

Note: Nand(a=firstinput, b=secondinput, out=whateverisoutputted) was given, all the other gates have to be implemented based on nand. see Week01_02.

For each chip, the chip architect creates:

- A chip API
- A test Script
- a compare file (expected)

Based on these, chip developers can build the chip since they ahve the API and tests.
