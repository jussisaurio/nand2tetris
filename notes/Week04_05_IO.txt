Hack Output:

ROM => instructions => CPU <=> RAM (contains Screen Memory Map)    <--- peripherals

Physical display is continuously refreshed from the screen memory map.
To draw on screen, simply manipulate the memory map.


Screen memory map in hack

- "Physical" display unit 256 x 512, black and white
- 8K 16-bit words allocated in map. 8192 * 16 = 256 * 512 = 131072
- Read/write operations are always 16-bit operations, so screen is divided to 16 logical rows and 32 logical columns

- To set pixel (y, x) on/off:
  1. word = Screen[32 * y + col / x]  <-- integer division, discard remainder. Screen is implemented using previously built components.
     word = RAM[16384 + 32*y + col/x] <-- Screen resides in a particular index of RAM
  2. set the (x % 16)'th bit of word to 0 or 1
  3. commit word back to RAM

  1 and 3 are done using regular RAM operations



Hack Input:

Physical display associated with a Keyboard Memory Map
Keyboard memory map only requires a single 16-bit register.

When key pressed, its scan code appears in the keyboard memory map (scan codes are by convention)
"No key" is mapped to 0.

To check which key currently pressed:
  - Probe the contents of the builtin Keyboard chip (i.e. a 16bit register at RAM[24576], in this case)
  - if 0, no key pressed, if x, consult agreed-upon scan codes
