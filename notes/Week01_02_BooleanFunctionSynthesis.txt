Truth Table to Boolean Expression?

x y z f
0 0 0 1 - NOT(x) AND NOT(y) AND NOT(z)
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 - NOT(x) AND y AND NOT(z)
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 - x AND NOT(y) AND NOT(z)
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0

f(x,y,z)
= (NOT(x) AND NOT(y) AND NOT(z)) OR (NOT(x) AND y AND NOT(z)) OR (x AND NOT(y) AND NOT(z))
= NOT(z) AND ( (NOT(x) AND NOT(y)) OR (NOT(x) AND y) OR (x AND NOT(y) )
= NOT(z) AND NOT(x AND y)

Theorem 1:
Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing only AND, OR and NOT operations!

Theorem 2:
Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing only AND, NOT operations!
Proof: (x OR y) = NOT (NOT(x) AND NOT(y)) # OR can be computed using AND and NOT

(x NAND y) = NOT(x AND y)

Theorem 3:
Any Boolean function can be represented using an expression containing only NAND operations!

Proof:

1) NOT (x) = x NAND x
2 x AND y = NOT (x NAND y) = (x NAND y) NAND (x NAND y)
