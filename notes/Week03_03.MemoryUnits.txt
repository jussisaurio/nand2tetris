Von Neumann Architecture for Computer Systems:

Input -> [ Memory <-> Cpu (ALU | Control) ] -> Output

Memory:

- Main memory: RAM (inside the computer)
- Secondary memory: hard disks, memory sticks
- Volatile / non-volatile (eg RAM is volatile, Disk is not -- i.e. persistence)

RAM:

- Data
- Instructions

Perspective:

- Physical memory (how memory is actually built)
- Logical memory (logical organization of memory -- the focus of this course)

The most basic memory element: Register

- 1 bit register from previous unit
- E.g. 16-bit register can be abstracted from 1-bit registers.
- w (word width) = 16, 32, 64 bit...
- 16-bit registers are the focus of this course
- Register's state: the value currently stored in the register.
