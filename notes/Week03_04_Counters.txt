Why are counters needed?

- Computer must keep track of which instruction to execute next (silly analogy: recipe steps for a cooking robot)
- This can be done with a program counter
- Program counter contains the address of the instruction that should be fetched and executed next
- Three control settings:
  * Reset (set x=0)
  * Next (set x=x+1)
  * GOTO (set x=n)

Inputs:

in (16)
load (1)
inc (1)
reset (1)

if reset[t] then out[t+1] = 0
elif inc[t] then out[t+1] = out[t] + 1
elif load[t] then out[t+1] = in
else out[t+1] = out[t]
