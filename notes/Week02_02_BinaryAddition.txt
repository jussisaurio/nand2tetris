All basic operations can be derived from binary addition (because negative numbers, etc).

Addition can be done using "elementary school carry the one" method:

00010101
+
01011100
=
01110001


What about overflow? Result doesn't fit to 8-bit "word size":

 10010101
 +
 11011100
101110001

displays 01110001


Building an adder:

1. Half adder - add two bits
2. Full adder - add three bits
3. Adder - adds two numbers


Half adder chip:

a b sum carry
0 0 0   0
0 1 1   0
1 0 1   0
1 1 0   1
