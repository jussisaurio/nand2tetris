Are the gates we've built standard? Yes!

Is the ALU we built standard? No. It is greatly simplified and not usual. It does not implement very complex operations like multiplication and division etc.
The software section of this course will include a math library in the OS which implements things like * and / etc. This will be completely transparent to the
high-level programmer.

Is the ALU efficient? Fairly, but for example the 16-bit adder has to go through a half adder and 15 full adders which all have multiple gates.
So the implementation of that would be an area to optimize, for example.


Should I use chips I built myself in these levels, or use chips given by the chip authors? Recommended to use the given chips because it guarantees that
bugs encountered in higher levels aren't because of erroneously implemented chips by the student. Also, the software-based built in chips have a much more
efficient implementation, so using the self-built ones would result in a slow computer.
