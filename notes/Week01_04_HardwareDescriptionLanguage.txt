HDL

Example HDL file:

/** Xor gate: out = (a And Not(b)) Or (Not(a) And b) */

CHIP Xor {
  IN a, b;
  OUT out;

  PARTS:
  Not (in=a, out=nota);
  Not (in=b, out=notb);
  And (a=a, b=notb, out=aAndNotb);
  And (a=nota, b=b, out=notaAndb);
  Or (a=aAndNotb, b=notaAndb, out=out);
}

# Section above PARTS is interface, below is implementation. Interface is unique, implementation may vary.

# HDL File is a textual description of a gate diagram.

# HDL is declarative / functional :) the description goes into hardware simulator that takes care of the procedural part.

# There are many HDLs, most common are:
- VHDL
- Verilog

The HDL in this course is similar in spirit to the "commercial" HDLs, but minimal and simple.
