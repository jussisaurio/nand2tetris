1-bit register (Bit) tips

- Use DFF and Mux

16-bit register tips:

- Build from 16 one-bit registers

8-Register RAM tips:

- Feed the in value to all registers simultaneously
- use Mux/DMux to select the right register

n-Register RAM tips:

- Stack RAM8's to yield RAM64, and so on.
- Think about the RAM's address input as consisting of two fields:
  * One field to select a RAM-part
  * Other field to select the register within that RAM part
- Use Mux/DMux to implement this addressing scheme.

Program Counter tips:

- Can be built from a register, an incrementor, and some previously-built logic gates.


General notes:

- Project 03 is divided into a and b directories because the parts in B defer to using built-in java implementations instead of our custom HDL from
  previous sections, since it's much more efficient. Similarly, although we built chips in projects 01/02, since they are not in the same directory,
  project 03 will use builtin chips when those level 1-2 chips are requested.

- DFF is a blackbox builtin in this project. However in reality DFF can be implemented eg. with two NANDs in a loop.
